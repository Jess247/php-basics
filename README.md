## How to declare variables

Variables always begin with a $ followed by an underscore or a letter. After the underscore you can use numbers or other characters.
Examples in variables.php

## How use operators

Operators are used for asignments, to perform mathematical calculations or for comparison.
Exampes in operators.php

# Different datatypes

The different datatypes are integers, booleans, float and strings.

Example in datatypes.php

# Variable Interpolation

They can be used to output the value of a variable along with other text. The '.' operator is used for interpolation.

Example in var-interpolation.php

# Escape-Sequences

Widely used Escape Sequences in PHP

- \' – To escape ' within single quoted string.
- \” – To escape “ within double quoted string.
- \\ – To escape the backslash.
- \$ – To escape $.
- \n – To add line breaks between string.
- \t – To add tab space.
- \r – For carriage return.

Examples in escape-sequences.php

# Herdoc

Herdoc is used for more complex stringliterals which contain a lot of text and multible variables.
